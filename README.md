# 7773_assignement
## Task 1:
* `7773-assignment` is the folder containing the scripts we will described during the class;
* `requirements.txt` holds the Python dependencies required for running the scripts.
- `regression_dataset.txt` is a fake regression dataset to run the code - you can generate another dataset with different parameters or cardinality using the `create_fake_dataset.py` script and use the syntax `python create_fake_dataset.py`;
* `flow.py` contains the script for task one. To run the script, please use the syntax : `COMET_API_KEY=xxx MY_PROJECT_NAME=yyy python flow.py run` with the API key.
